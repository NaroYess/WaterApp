        <!-- Benefits of drinking water -->

        <div class="row">
            <div class="box">
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    
                    <h2 class="intro-text text-center"><strong> Benefits </strong> of Drinking Water
                    </h2>
                    
                    <p> <b>1. Fluid Balance. </b>Roughly 60 percent of the body is 
                    made of water. Drinking enough H2O maintains the body’s fluid 
                    balance, which helps transport nutrients in the body, regulate 
                    body temperature, digest food, and more. </p>

                    <p> <b>2. Calorie Control.</b>Forget other diet tricks—drinking 
                    water could also help with weight loss. Numerous studies have 
                    found a connection between water consumption and losing a few pounds. 
                    The secret reason? Water simply helps people feel full, and as a 
                    result consume fewer calories. </p>

                    <p> <b>3. Muscle Fuel.</b>Sweating at the gym causes muscles to 
                    lose water. And when the muscles don’t have enough water, they 
                    get tired . So for extra energy, try drinking water to push 
                    through that final set of squats. </p>

                    <p> <b>4. Clear Skin.</b> Certain toxins in the body can cause
                    the skin to inflame, which results in clogged pores and acne . 
                    While science saying water makes the skin wrinkle free is
                     contradictory, water does flush out these toxins and can reduce 
                     the risk of pimples.</p>

                    <p> <b>5. Kidney Function.</b> Our kidneys process 200 quarts
                    of blood daily, sifting out waste and transporting urine to 
                    the bladder. Yet, kidneys need  enough fluids to clear away 
                    what we don’t need in the body. Let's drink to that!</p>

                    <p> <b>6. Productivity Boost.</b> In order to really focus, 
                    a glass of water could help people concentrate and stay 
                    refreshed and alert.</p>

                    <p> <b>7. Fatigue Buster.</b> Move over coffee—water can 
                    help fight those tired eyes too . One of the most common 
                    symptoms of dehydration is tiredness. Just another reason 
                    to go for the big gulp! (Not the 7-11 kind.)</p>

                    <p> <b>8. Hangover Help.</b> If booze has got the best of
                    you, help a hangover with a glass of water to hydrate the
                    body and stop that pounding headache.</p>


                    <p> <b>9. Pain Prevention.</b> A little water can really go 
                    a long way. Aching joints and muscle cramps and strains can 
                    all occur if the body is dehydrated .</p>

                    <p> <b>9.Keep Things Flowing.</b> Nobody wants to deal with 
                    digestion issues. Luckily, drinking enough water adds fluids 
                    to the colon which helps make things, ahem, move smoothly.</p>

                    <p> <b>10.Sickness Fighter.</b> Water may help with decongestion 
                    and dehydration, helping the body bounce back when feeling under
                    the weather. Just beware—drinking fluids hasn’t been scientifically
                    proven to beat colds in one swoop, so don’t swap this for a trip 
                    to the doctor or other cold remedies.</p>

                    <p> <b>11.Brain Boost.</b>  A study in London found a link between
                    students bringing water into an exam room and better grades, 
                    suggesting H2O promotes clearer thinking. While it’s unclear if 
                    drinking the water had anything to do with a better score, 
                    it doesn’t hurt to try it out! </p>                </div>
