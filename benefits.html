		<h2>Benefits of Drinking Water </h2>

			<p> <b>1. Fluid Balance. </b>Roughly 60 percent of the body is 
			made of water. Drinking enough H2O maintains the body’s fluid 
			balance, which helps transport nutrients in the body, regulate 
			body temperature, digest food, and more. </p>

			<p> <b>2. Calorie Control.</b>Forget other diet tricks—drinking 
			water could also help with weight loss. Numerous studies have 
			found a connection between water consumption and losing a few pounds. 
			The secret reason? Water simply helps people feel full, and as a 
			result consume fewer calories. </p>

			<p> <b>3. Muscle Fuel.</b>Sweating at the gym causes muscles to 
			lose water. And when the muscles don’t have enough water, they 
			get tired . So for extra energy, try drinking water to push 
			through that final set of squats. </p>

			<p> <b>4. Clear Skin.</b> Certain toxins in the body can cause
			the skin to inflame, which results in clogged pores and acne . 
			While science saying water makes the skin wrinkle free is
			 contradictory, water does flush out these toxins and can reduce 
			 the risk of pimples.</p>

			<p> <b>5. Kidney Function.</b> Our kidneys process 200 quarts
			of blood daily, sifting out waste and transporting urine to 
			the bladder. Yet, kidneys need  enough fluids to clear away 
			what we don’t need in the body. Let's drink to that!</p>

			<p> <b>6. Productivity Boost.</b> In order to really focus, 
			a glass of water could help people concentrate and stay 
			refreshed and alert.</p>

			<p> <b>7. Fatigue Buster.</b> Move over coffee—water can 
			help fight those tired eyes too . One of the most common 
			symptoms of dehydration is tiredness. Just another reason 
			to go for the big gulp! (Not the 7-11 kind.)</p>

			<p> <b>8. Hangover Help.</b> If booze has got the best of
			you, help a hangover with a glass of water to hydrate the
			body and stop that pounding headache.</p>


			<p> <b>9. Pain Prevention.</b> A little water can really go 
			a long way. Aching joints and muscle cramps and strains can 
			all occur if the body is dehydrated .</p>

			<p> <b>9.Keep Things Flowing.</b> Nobody wants to deal with 
			digestion issues. Luckily, drinking enough water adds fluids 
			to the colon which helps make things, ahem, move smoothly.</p>

			<p> <b>10.Sickness Fighter.</b> Water may help with decongestion 
			and dehydration, helping the body bounce back when feeling under
			the weather. Just beware—drinking fluids hasn’t been scientifically
			proven to beat colds in one swoop, so don’t swap this for a trip 
			to the doctor or other cold remedies.</p>

			<p> <b>11.Brain Boost.</b>  A study in London found a link between
			students bringing water into an exam room and better grades, 
			suggesting H2O promotes clearer thinking. While it’s unclear if 
			drinking the water had anything to do with a better score, 
			it doesn’t hurt to try it out! </p>
